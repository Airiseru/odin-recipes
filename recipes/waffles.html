        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Great-tasting waffle for breakfast and picky eaters.</p>
        <p>This recipe is by Mike Mader found in the <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232154/buttermilk-oatmeal-waffles/">allrecipes website.</a></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two and one-half cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>One and one-half cups rolled oats</li>
            <li>Three tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>Two tablespoons baking powder</li>
            <li>One and one-half tablespoons salt</li>
            <li>Four eggs, separated</li>
            <li>One and one-half cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>One cup milk</li>
            <li>One-half cup melted butter</li>
            <li>One and one-half teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Mix flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat egg yolks in another bowl, reserving egg whites in a third bowl. Add buttermilk, milk, and melted butter to egg yolks; beat until well mixed. Pour buttermilk mixture into flour mixture; beat until batter is blended.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites and vanilla extract in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Fold half the egg whites into the buttermilk batter until egg whites are incorporated; repeat with remaining half.</li>
            <li>Ladle batter into preheated waffle iron. Cook until waffles are golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer waffle to a paper towel-lined plate to prevent sogginess and repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
